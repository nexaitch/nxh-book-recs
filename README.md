# nxh's Book Recommendations

A list of helpful (and free!) online textbooks. In general these are ones I've read (feel free to make suggestions and pull requests, though do know that I will only add books I've read).

TODO: short writeup for each book, maybe a table of contents

## Computing

### General / Introductory

* [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/index.html) — classic textbook on foundations of Programming, but also provides introduction to functional programming concepts with Scheme
* [How to Design Programs](https://htdp.org/) — introductory textbook on (functional) programming with Racket (a Scheme dialect), which takes a rather unique top-down approach to problem solving
* [Composing Programs](https://www.composingprograms.com/) (Pythonic adaptation of SICP)
* [Clojure for the Brave and True](https://www.braveclojure.com/clojure-for-the-brave-and-true/) (Clojure)
* [Learn you a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) Intro to Haskell (a functional programming language) for programmers in Imperative languages (who have not done functional programming before)
* [Project Based Learning](https://github.com/practical-tutorials/project-based-learning) — collection of other project based resources

### Algorithms / Data Structures

* [Algorithms by Jeff Ericsson](https://algorithms.wtf)
* [Open Data Structures](https://opendatastructures.org/)

### Deep Learning

* [Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/)
* [Neural Networks for Chess](https://github.com/asdfjkl/neural_network_chess)
* [Reinforcement Learning: an Introduction](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html)

## Mathematics 

* [Open Textbook Initiative](https://aimath.org/textbooks/) — resource from American Institute of Mathematics with links to high-quality open access textbooks in various fields of Mathematics

## Linguistics / Languages

* [Lexical Sets (for Actors)](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/lexicalsets/) — an Open Textbook on English Vowels and their many pronunciations in different varieties on English. Targeted at actors, but very useful resource for people interested in English phonetics (not just RP and GenAm)
